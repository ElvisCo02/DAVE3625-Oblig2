You have 10 days to work on a machine learning algorithm. I want you to pick one of the following use cases and make a prediction algorithm using either regression or classification algorithms.

Do the following:

Pick one use case (defined below).
Explore and research which algorithm would work best for this use case (regression or classification)
Document your findings in a file (3-5 lines) on why you chose this algorithm.
Train the algorithm using Python
Keep the solution as simple as possible. We are not looking for the best machine learning algorithm. We are interested in seeing that you know how to work with machine learning.
Publish the code on GitHub and send us the link
You can pick one of the following use cases:

Predict stock market price for TESLA. I want you to make a prediction algorithm which predicts the price of this stock on a specific date. Input will be date and output should be price of that stock (close value in the data file). You should also show the prediction percentage score. Data file: TESLA.csv For updated csv file, please download the data from: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history?p=TSLA

Predict passenger data for Ruter Use the same data set given to you in assignment 1. I want you to make a prediction algorithm which predicts the number of passengers on a specific date for a specific bus (pick any one). Input should be date and output will be number of passengers You should also show the prediction percentage score. Data file: Ruter_data.csv

Note:
- vi velger stock market price og skal bruke regression.


Why we choose regression for this use case:
To predict the stock price for Tesla on a specific date, a regression algorithm would be more suitable. Regression models are designed to predict continuous values, making them well-suited for predicting stock prices, which involve continuous numerical data.
